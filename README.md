# Siamese-network
This project is a research notebook in which i implemented a Siamese network in order to determin if two faces are of the same person. 

The data is from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/index.html
To solve this problam I tried to implement a Siamese network from a paper: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf
